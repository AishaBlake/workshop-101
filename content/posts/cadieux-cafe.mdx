<BioContent />

[Cadieux Cafe](http://www.cadieuxcafe.com/) is the best!!

## Belgian Influence

Cadieux Cafe has several nods to Belgium:

- feather bowling
- Belgian flags
- Belgian beer

### Feather Bowling

Feather bowling is a lot like **bocce ball**, except you roll what looks like a wheel of _cheese_!
